                <h2>Why am I so obsessed with Phad See Ew?</h2>
                <p>There's just something about the flavor. Especially
                    after you add the wide noodles and the sauce!  And then
                    you mix in those veggies and seafood (which is not cheap,
                    by the way!)--that to me is the ultimate comfort food.
                    Any chance I could drag myself to a Thai restaurant, I would
                    make sure I order it.

                <p>
                    I first tried it during my undergrad studies. I would always
                    pair it with a thai tea.  That was always the best way to go.
                    Whenever I had a bad day, Phad See Ew was the way to go for me.
                    Every time I was in class, Phad See Ew was on my mind.  A lot.
